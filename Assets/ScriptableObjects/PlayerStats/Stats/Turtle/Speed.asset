  description:
  - Research, design, and fasten a newly designed propulsion system with propellers
    into the device attached to the underside of the shell, increasing your speed
    and allowing you to avoid obstacles more quickly.
  - "Research methods to streamline the device\u2019s shell to minimize drag and
    improve hydrodynamic efficiency, reaching higher speeds than before."
  - "Develop a more efficient higher-powered motor compatible with the device\u2019s
    propulsion system to increase the thrust generated and achieve greater acceleration."
  - Design and swap the propellers with better blades that optimize the pitch and
    diameter of the propellers for enhanced performance.
  - Swap the propellers for a new and improved jet propulsion system that is more
    efficient and maneuverable to reach top speeds underwater.
