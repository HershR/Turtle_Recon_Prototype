  description:
  - Collaborate with the Ocean Cleanup nonprofit organization to develop mechanical
    collection devices aimed at passively removing floating plastic debris.
  - "Work with The Ocean Cleanup\u2019s Aerial Expedition to use drones and satellites
    to survey the ocean and map debris, enabling targeting cleanup efforts."
  - Research remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) with the Ocean Voyages Institute to
    remove debris from deeper ocean layers.
  - Design microplastic filtration technology to be integrated into existing ocean
    infrastructure and prevent microplastics from entering the marine environment.
  - Research biological degradation and remediation techniques that leverage natural
    processes to break down and remove pollutants from the ocean.
