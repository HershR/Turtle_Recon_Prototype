  description:
  - Convert research data into documents with concrete evidence on the damaging effects
    of ocean acidification to convince government agencies to implement policies
    on limiting carbon emissions.
  - Explore methods to enhance ocean alkalinity as means of counteracting ocean acidification
    by adding alkaline substances, such as magnesium, to seawater to increase its
    buffering capacity and raise pH levels.
  - Collaborate with the Blue Carbon Initiative program to restore and conserve coastal
    ecosystems that sequester and store carbon as natural carbon sinks.
  - Along with Project Vesta, investigate the feasibility of using volcanic rocks
    and minerals to capture and mineralize CO2 in the ocean, forming stable carbonate
    minerals that effectively remove carbon from the carbon cycle.
  - Explore oceanic afforestation with the Climate Foundation on creating artificial
    forests of seaweed to absorb CO2 from seawater and promote oceanic biodiversity.
