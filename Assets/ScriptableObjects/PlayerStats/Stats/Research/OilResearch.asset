  description:
  - Develop mechanical skimming devices that collect oil, which is then transferred
    to storage tanks for disposal or recovery.
  - Research effective chemical dispersants to break up oil slicks into smaller droplets,
    facilitating their natural dispersion and biodegradation.
  - Collaborate with nonprofit organizations to research bioremediation techniques
    that harness natural microbial processes to degrade oil contaminants in the marine
    environment.
  - Develop and deploy advanced sorbent materials designed to selectively absorb
    and remove oil from the ocean surface.
  - Collaborate with government agencies to research electrocoagulation systems that
    utilize electrical currents to destabilize and aggregate oil droplets, facilitating
    their removal through filtration or flotation processes.
